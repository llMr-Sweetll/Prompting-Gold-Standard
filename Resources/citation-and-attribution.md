# Citation and Attribution for AI-Assisted Work

## What to Cite

- External sources: studies, datasets, standards, code, and images
- AI assistance: disclose tool/provider, date, and purpose (e.g., outline, editing)

## Where to Cite

- In-text near claims (numbers, quotations, contested statements)
- Reference list with full bibliographic information
- Methods/acknowledgements for AI-use disclosure

## Example AI Disclosure

"An AI assistant was used for [tasks: e.g., brainstorming, copy-editing] on [date]. All analysis and conclusions are the authorâ€™s. Claims have been verified against the cited sources."

## Common Styles

- APA 7: Cite sources normally; include AI disclosure in Methods/Acknowledgements
- MLA/Chicago/IEEE: Follow venue guidance; be explicit and precise in disclosure

## Quality Practices

- Validate DOIs/URLs; include retrieval dates
- Avoid placeholder citations; remove any that cannot be verified
- Map every major claim to at least one reliable source
