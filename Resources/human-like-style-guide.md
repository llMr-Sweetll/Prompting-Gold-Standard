# Human-like Writing Style Guide (AI-Assisted)

## Goals

Produce clear, empathetic, and readable prose that reflects authentic human communication—without imitating identifiable living authors.

## Core Style Principles

- Clarity: short sentences, concrete nouns, active voice
- Purpose: front-load key points; one idea per paragraph
- Cohesion: transitions, parallel structure, consistent terminology
- Tone: match audience and context; avoid condescension and hype
- Specificity: examples, numbers, and cases over vague generalities

## Do/Don’t

- Do: vary sentence length; mix simple and complex clauses
- Do: define jargon or swap for plain language when possible
- Don’t: imitate specific living authors’ styles on request
- Don’t: over-hedge or overstate certainty; quantify when possible

## Voice Polishing Prompts

Clarity pass:
```
Rewrite for clarity and flow. Shorten sentences, trim redundancy, and ensure one idea per paragraph. Preserve meaning; do not add claims.
```

Tone alignment:
```
Adjust tone for [audience: e.g., board-level, undergraduate, policy-makers]. Maintain accuracy and include definitions for domain terms as needed.
```

Human cadence:
```
Increase sentence variability and reduce repetitive phrasing. Preserve facts and citations.
```

## Style Audit

Use JSON-Schemas/style-audit.json to quantify readability, variability, and jargon density. Treat scores as guides, not absolutes; favor clarity and truth over rigid metrics.
