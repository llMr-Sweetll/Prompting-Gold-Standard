# Source Reliability and Evidence Hierarchy

## Evidence Hierarchy (Typical)

1) Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
2) Peer-reviewed studies (RCTs, high-quality observational)
3) Authoritative reports (government/standards bodies)
4) Reputable industry whitepapers and technical docs
5) News and blogs with transparent sourcing

## Selection Principles

- Prefer primary over secondary sources for critical claims
- Use the most recent credible source when findings evolve quickly
- Triangulate across independent sources for contentious topics
- Record retrieval dates for web content; archive if possible

## Red Flags

- Missing authorship, date, or publisher
- Extraordinary claims without supporting evidence
- Broken or circular references
- Predatory journals or undisclosed conflicts of interest

## Prompt Guards

```
Only use sources that clearly identify authorship, date, and publisher. If a source is questionable, propose alternatives from higher tiers in the evidence hierarchy.
