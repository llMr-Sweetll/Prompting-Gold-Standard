### 2. Tight Coupling
**Problem**: Classes heavily dependent on each other
**Solution**: Implement Dependency Inversion and use interfaces for abstraction

### 3. Code Duplication
**Problem**: Repeated code patterns throughout the codebase
**Solution**: Extract common functionality into reusable components and utilities

### 4. Primitive Obsession
**Problem**: Overuse of primitive types instead of domain objects
**Solution**: Create value objects and domain primitives with validation

### 5. Feature Envy
**Problem**: Methods accessing data from other classes excessively
**Solution**: Move methods to the class that contains the data they operate on

### 6. Inappropriate Intimacy
**Problem**: Classes accessing each other's private parts
**Solution**: Use proper encapsulation and expose only necessary interfaces
