# Context Engineering for LLMs

## Overview

Context engineering is the strategic management of information provided to Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize their understanding, reasoning, and output quality. While prompt engineering focuses on how to ask, context engineering focuses on what information to provide and how to structure it.

## Core Principles

### 1. Information Relevance
The most critical aspect of context engineering is ensuring all provided information is directly relevant to the task.

**Poor Context:**
```
Here's a novel, a recipe book, and some stock market data. Now write about climate change.
```

**Optimal Context:**
```
Recent studies show that Arctic sea ice extent has declined by 13% per decade since 1979. The Greenland ice sheet lost an average of 279 gigatons of ice per year between 1993-2019. Global sea levels have risen approximately 20 cm since 1900.

Based on this data, analyze the current trends in climate change and their projected impacts on coastal cities.
```

### 2. Information Hierarchy
Structure context with the most important information first, followed by supporting details.

**Example Structure:**
```
[Core Facts] → [Supporting Evidence] → [Background Context] → [Related Information]
```

### 3. Context Window Management
Be aware of token limits and prioritize information accordingly.

- **GPT-5**: ~128,000 tokens (approximately 96,000 words)
- **Claude**: ~200,000 tokens (approximately 150,000 words)
- **Gemini Pro**: ~30,000 tokens (approximately 22,000 words)

## Context Types and Applications

### 1. Factual Context
Providing specific data, statistics, and verified information.

**Example:**
```
Context: According to the World Health Organization's 2023 Global Health Report:
- Mental health conditions affect 1 in 8 people worldwide
- Depression is the leading cause of disability globally
- Investment in mental health services yields a 4:1 return on investment

Task: Write a policy brief on the economic benefits of mental health investment.
```

### 2. Procedural Context
Providing step-by-step processes or methodologies.

**Example:**
```
Context: The systematic literature review process involves:
1. Define research question using PICO framework
2. Identify search terms and databases
3. Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria
4. Extract data using standardized forms
5. Assess quality using appropriate tools
6. Synthesize findings using meta-analysis or narrative synthesis

Task: Create a protocol for conducting a systematic review on telemedicine effectiveness.
```

### 3. Domain-Specific Context
Providing specialized knowledge relevant to a particular field.

**Example:**
```
Context: In bioinformatics, BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) uses:
- E-value: Expected number of chance alignments
- Bit score: Normalized score based on substitution matrix
- Identity percentage: Exact matches between sequences
- Gap penalties: Costs for insertions/deletions in alignment

Task: Explain how to interpret BLAST results for protein sequence analysis.
```

### 4. Temporal Context
Providing information about timing, sequences, or historical context.

**Example:**
```
Context: Timeline of CRISPR technology development:
- 1987: Discovery of CRISPR sequences in bacteria
- 2007: CRISPR identified as adaptive immune system
- 2012: First demonstration of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing
- 2015: First clinical trials begin
- 2020: FDA approval for sickle cell disease treatment
- 2023: Expansion to agriculture and environmental applications

Task: Analyze the ethical evolution of CRISPR technology from discovery to clinical application.
```

## Context Structuring Techniques

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
Start with essential information and add details as needed.

**Layered Context:**
```
Layer 1 (Essential): [Core facts and immediate requirements]
Layer 2 (Important): [Supporting data and key constraints]
Layer 3 (Helpful): [Additional context and examples]
Layer 4 (Optional): [Supplementary information and alternatives]
```

### 2. Contextual Framing
Set the appropriate perspective or viewpoint for the task.

**Example:**
```
Frame: You are a senior policy advisor to the United Nations Environment Programme with 15 years of experience in climate policy and international negotiations.

Context: The 2023 IPCC report indicates a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C if emissions peak before 2025 and are reduced by 43% by 2030.

Task: Draft a position statement for the upcoming COP conference.
```

### 3. Contrasting Context
Provide multiple perspectives to encourage balanced analysis.

**Example:**
```
Context - Economic Perspective:
- GDP growth of 3.2% in renewable energy sectors
- Job creation: 12 million new positions by 2030
- Cost reduction: Solar panel costs down 90% since 2010

Context - Social Perspective:
- Environmental justice concerns in mining communities
- Indigenous land rights conflicts
- Digital divide in technology access

Task: Analyze the complex impacts of renewable energy transition.
```

## Context Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Information Density Optimization
Balance between providing sufficient context and avoiding information overload.

**Techniques:**
- Use bullet points for lists and key facts
- Prioritize recent, relevant data
- Summarize lengthy information
- Use tables for structured data

### 2. Context Relevance Assessment
Regularly evaluate whether provided context contributes to task completion.

**Checklist:**
- Is this information directly related to the task?
- Could the task be completed without this information?
- Is there more current or accurate information available?
- Does this context introduce unnecessary complexity?

### 3. Dynamic Context Adjustment
Modify context based on AI responses and iterative refinement.

**Example Workflow:**
1. Provide initial context and get AI response
2. Identify gaps or inaccuracies in the response
3. Add clarifying context or correct information
4. Request revised response with updated context

### 4. Context Documentation
Maintain clear records of context provided for reproducibility.

**Template:**
```
Context ID: [Unique identifier]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Purpose: [Specific task or objective]
Information Sources: [URLs, citations, data sources]
Key Facts: [Bullet points of critical information]
Context Type: [Factual, procedural, domain-specific, etc.]
Token Count: [Number of tokens used]
```

## Common Context Engineering Mistakes

### 1. Context Dumping
Providing too much irrelevant information.

**Problem:**
```
[Entire textbook chapter + irrelevant articles + personal notes + old data]
```

**Solution:**
```
[Key findings + specific data points + relevant methodology + current statistics]
```

### 2. Missing Critical Context
Omitting essential information needed for accurate responses.

**Problem:**
```
Analyze the effectiveness of this marketing campaign.
[No data provided]
```

**Solution:**
```
Analyze the effectiveness of this marketing campaign using these metrics:
- Reach: 2.1 million impressions
- Engagement rate: 4.8%
- Conversion rate: 2.3%
- Cost per acquisition: $45.20
- Target audience demographics: 25-34 year olds, urban areas
```

### 3. Outdated Information
Using stale data without verification.

**Problem:**
```
Based on 2018 data, social media usage among teenagers...
```

**Solution:**
```
Based on 2023 Pew Research data, social media usage among teenagers (13-17):
- 95% use YouTube
- 67% use TikTok
- 52% use Instagram
- 41% use Snapchat
```

### 4. Ambiguous Context
Providing unclear or contradictory information.

**Problem:**
```
The study shows significant results (p < 0.05) but the effect size is small (d = 0.2). The sample size was adequate with 1,200 participants.
```

**Solution:**
```
Statistical results summary:
- Statistical significance: p < 0.05 (reject null hypothesis)
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.2 (small effect)
- Sample size: n = 1,200 (adequate power > 0.80)
- Confidence interval: 95% CI [0.15, 0.25]
```

## Advanced Context Engineering

### 1. Multi-Modal Context
Combining text with other forms of information.

**Example:**
```
Context: [Research paper abstract] + [Data visualization description] + [Statistical summary table] + [Key quotes from interviews]

Task: Synthesize mixed-methods research findings.
```

### 2. Conditional Context
Providing context that changes based on AI responses.

**Example:**
```
Initial Context: Basic study parameters
If AI asks for methodology → Provide detailed methods
If AI requests data analysis → Provide statistical results
If AI needs interpretation → Provide theoretical framework
```

### 3. Context Compression
Using summarization techniques to include more information efficiently.

**Techniques:**
- Extractive summarization (key sentences)
- Abstractive summarization (paraphrased key points)
- Bullet point format for dense information
- Hierarchical organization (main points → details)

### 4. Context Versioning
Maintaining different versions of context for different purposes.

**Example:**
- **Academic Version**: Full citations, methodological details, theoretical frameworks
- **Executive Version**: Key findings, implications, recommendations
- **Technical Version**: Detailed specifications, data analysis, technical constraints
