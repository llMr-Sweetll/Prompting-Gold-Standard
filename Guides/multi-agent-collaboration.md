# Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework

Practical patterns for orchestrating multiple AI agents to solve complex problems through coordinated task decomposition, inter-agent communication, and consensus mechanisms.

## Core Agent Types

### 1. Task Decomposition Agent
```
Specializes in breaking complex problems into manageable subtasks.
```
**System Prompt:**
```
You are a Task Decomposition Specialist. Your role is to analyze complex problems and break them down into logical, sequential subtasks that can be distributed among specialized agents.

Rules:
- Identify the core objective and success criteria
- Break down into 3-7 logical subtasks
- Define clear interfaces between subtasks
- Estimate resource requirements for each subtask
- Identify dependencies and parallelization opportunities

Output Format:
- Task Summary (2-3 sentences)
- Subtask Breakdown (numbered list with descriptions)
- Dependencies Matrix (which tasks depend on others)
- Estimated Complexity (High/Medium/Low per subtask)
```

### 2. Domain Specialist Agents
```
Subject matter experts for specific domains (research, coding, analysis, etc.)
```

**Research Agent:**
```
You are a Research Specialist Agent. Your expertise includes:
- Literature review and synthesis
- Hypothesis generation and testing
- Data collection and validation
- Evidence-based reasoning

Focus on: Thoroughness, accuracy, current best practices
Communication Style: Formal, evidence-based, methodical
```

**Code Generation Agent:**
```
You are a Software Development Agent. Your expertise includes:
- Algorithm design and implementation
- Code optimization and performance
- Error handling and testing
- Documentation and maintainability

Focus on: Clean code, efficiency, scalability, security
Communication Style: Technical, precise, solution-oriented
```

**Analysis Agent:**
```
You are a Data Analysis Agent. Your expertise includes:
- Statistical analysis and modeling
- Data visualization and interpretation
- Pattern recognition and insights
- Quality assurance and validation

Focus on: Rigor, clarity, actionable insights
Communication Style: Analytical, evidence-based, conclusive
```

### 3. Integration & Synthesis Agent
```
Combines outputs from multiple agents into cohesive solutions.
```

**System Prompt:**
```
You are an Integration Specialist. Your role is to:
- Synthesize information from multiple specialized agents
- Resolve conflicts and inconsistencies
- Create unified, coherent outputs
- Ensure overall solution quality and completeness

Integration Rules:
- Identify common themes and patterns across agent outputs
- Resolve contradictions through evidence-based reasoning
- Fill gaps with logical inferences
- Maintain consistency in terminology and approach
- Provide confidence scores for integrated conclusions
```

## Communication Protocols

### Message Format Standard
```json
{
  "message_id": "unique_identifier",
  "sender_agent": "agent_name",
  "recipient_agent": "target_agent_or_all",
  "message_type": "task_assignment|progress_update|result_delivery|error_report|coordination_request",
  "timestamp": "ISO_8601_timestamp",
  "content": {
    "task_id": "parent_task_identifier",
    "data": {},
    "metadata": {
      "confidence_score": 0.85,
      "processing_time": 120,
      "resources_used": "cpu:2gb, memory:4gb"
    }
  },
  "requires_response": true|false
}
```

### Coordination Patterns

#### 1. Sequential Processing
```
Agent A → Process Task 1 → Send Results to Agent B
Agent B → Process Task 2 using Agent A results → Send to Agent C
Agent C → Final Integration → Deliver Complete Solution
```

#### 2. Parallel Processing
```
Coordinator → Split Task into Subtasks
  ├─ Agent A → Subtask 1
  ├─ Agent B → Subtask 2
  └─ Agent C → Subtask 3
Integration Agent → Combine All Results
```

#### 3. Iterative Refinement
```
Initial Task → Agent A (Draft) → Agent B (Review) → Agent A (Revise) → Agent C (Validate) → Final Output
```

## Agent Orchestration Examples

### Research Paper Generation
```
1. Task Decomposition Agent
   - Breaks down paper requirements into sections
   - Identifies research gaps and key questions

2. Research Agent
   - Conducts literature review
   - Generates hypotheses and methodology

3. Writing Agent
   - Drafts paper sections
   - Ensures academic tone and structure

4. Review Agent
   - Checks for completeness and coherence
   - Validates citations and arguments

5. Integration Agent
   - Combines all sections
   - Ensures consistent voice and flow
```

### Software Development Pipeline
```
1. Requirements Agent
   - Analyzes user requirements
   - Creates detailed specifications

2. Architecture Agent
   - Designs system architecture
   - Defines component interactions

3. Code Generation Agent
   - Implements individual components
   - Ensures code quality and standards

4. Testing Agent
   - Creates comprehensive test suites
   - Validates functionality and performance

5. Documentation Agent
   - Generates technical documentation
   - Creates user guides and API references

6. Integration Agent
   - Assembles complete system
   - Ensures all components work together
```

## Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

### Evidence-Based Resolution
```
When agents disagree:
1. Collect evidence from all perspectives
2. Evaluate evidence quality and relevance
3. Apply domain-specific resolution rules
4. Document reasoning for final decision
5. Update agent knowledge based on resolution
```

### Consensus Building
```
Multi-agent consensus process:
1. Each agent provides confidence score with recommendation
2. Weighted voting based on agent expertise and track record
3. Majority consensus or escalation to human expert
4. Document consensus process for audit trail
```

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Agent Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of outputs validated against ground truth
- **Consistency**: Agreement between multiple runs on same input
- **Efficiency**: Processing time and resource utilization
- **Collaboration Score**: Effectiveness in multi-agent scenarios

### Continuous Learning
```
Agent improvement mechanisms:
1. Performance tracking and analysis
2. Error pattern identification
3. Prompt refinement based on feedback
4. Knowledge base updates from successful collaborations
```

## Implementation Examples

### Bash Orchestration Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Initialize agents
declare -A agents=(
  ["research"]="research_agent"
  ["code"]="code_generation_agent"
  ["analysis"]="data_analysis_agent"
  ["integration"]="integration_agent"
)

# Task decomposition
echo "Starting task decomposition..."
task_breakdown=$(run_agent "decomposition" "break down: $TASK_DESCRIPTION")

# Parallel execution
echo "Executing subtasks in parallel..."
research_result=$(run_agent "research" "$task_breakdown" &) &
code_result=$(run_agent "code" "$task_breakdown" &) &
analysis_result=$(run_agent "analysis" "$task_breakdown" &) &
wait

# Integration
echo "Integrating results..."
final_result=$(run_agent "integration" "$research_result $code_result $analysis_result")

echo "Multi-agent collaboration complete!"
echo "Final result: $final_result"
```

### Agent State Management

3. **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and recovery
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and performance tracking
5. **Versioning**: Track agent versions and capability changes

### Collaboration Guidelines
1. **Clear Communication**: Use structured message formats
2. **Dependency Management**: Explicit task dependencies and sequencing
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Defined processes for handling disagreements
4. **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints at each collaboration stage
5. **Audit Trails**: Complete records of agent interactions and decisions

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Load Balancing**: Distribute work across multiple agent instances

4. **Async Processing**: Handle long-running tasks without blocking
5. **Failure Recovery**: Automatic retry and alternative agent selection
