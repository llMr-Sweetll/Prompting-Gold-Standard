# Quickstart: Multi-Modal Image Analysis Workflow

Complete image processing and analysis pipeline combining visual AI with structured data extraction. Produces:
- `image_analysis.json` (comprehensive visual analysis results)
- `content_description.md` (detailed image content description)
- `quality_assessment.json` (technical quality metrics)

References: `JSON-Schemas/image-analysis.json`, `Guides/advanced-techniques.md`, `Applications/data-analysis-and-visualization.md`.

## 0) Image Context Setup
```bash
cat > image_context.txt <<'EOF'
Image Type: Medical X-Ray
Domain: Healthcare Diagnostics
Analysis Focus: Fracture Detection and Classification
Quality Requirements: High-resolution, clear contrast
Privacy Level: PHI (Protected Health Information)
EOF

echo 'Analysis Objective: Detect and classify bone fractures in orthopedic X-rays with confidence scoring and clinical recommendations' > analysis_objective.txt
```

PowerShell alternative:
```powershell
@'
Image Type: Medical X-Ray
Domain: Healthcare Diagnostics
Analysis Focus: Fracture Detection and Classification
Quality Requirements: High-resolution, clear contrast
Privacy Level: PHI (Protected Health Information)
'@ | Set-Content image_context.txt

@'Analysis Objective: Detect and classify bone fractures in orthopedic X-rays with confidence scoring and clinical recommendations'@ | Set-Content analysis_objective.txt
```

## 1) Image Quality Assessment (Technical Analysis)
```
Analyze image technical quality and preprocessing requirements.
```

### Bash (OpenAI Vision with Schema Validation)
```bash
SCHEMA=$(cat Prompting-Gold-Standard/JSON-Schemas/image-analysis.json)

SYSTEM='Analyze image quality metrics and preprocessing requirements. Return valid JSON matching the schema with technical quality assessment.'

USER=$(cat <<'USR'
Image Context:
$(cat image_context.txt)

Analysis Requirements:
$(cat analysis_objective.txt)

Assess image quality for:
- Resolution and clarity metrics
- Contrast and brightness analysis
- Noise and artifact detection
- Preprocessing recommendations
- Diagnostic suitability scoring
USR
)

# Note: This would use GPT-4 Vision API in production
# For demo purposes, showing the structure
echo "Quality assessment would analyze image using GPT-4 Vision API"
echo "Schema validation ensures structured output format"
```

### PowerShell (OpenAI Vision)
```powershell
$SYSTEM = 'Analyze image quality metrics and preprocessing requirements. Return valid JSON with technical quality assessment.'

$USER = @"
Image Context:
$(Get-Content -Raw image_context.txt)

Analysis Requirements:
$(Get-Content -Raw analysis_objective.txt)

Assess image quality for:
- Resolution and clarity metrics

"@

# GPT-4 Vision API call structure
$body = @{
  model = "gpt-4-vision-preview"
  messages = @(
    @{role='system';content=$SYSTEM},
    @{role='user';content=$USER}
    # Image would be included here as base64 or URL
  )
  max_tokens = 1000
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

# $resp = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions' -Headers @{Authorization = "Bearer $env:OPENAI_API_KEY"} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body
# Set-Content -Path quality_assessment.json -Value ($resp.choices[0].message.content | ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json)
```

## 2) Visual Content Analysis (Multi-Modal Processing)
```
Extract and analyze visual content with clinical expertise.
```

### Bash (OpenAI Vision + GPT-4)
```bash
CONTENT_SYSTEM='Provide detailed visual analysis with clinical expertise. Describe anatomical structures, identify abnormalities, and provide diagnostic insights.'

CONTENT_USER=$(cat <<'USR'
Clinical Context:
$(cat image_context.txt)

Analysis Task:
$(cat analysis_objective.txt)

Provide comprehensive analysis including:
1. Anatomical structure identification
2. Abnormal finding detection and localization
3. Fracture classification (if present)
4. Severity assessment and measurements
5. Clinical significance and recommendations
6. Confidence scoring for each finding
USR
)

# Multi-step analysis: Vision for visual features + GPT-4 for clinical interpretation
echo "Step 1: Visual feature extraction using GPT-4 Vision"
echo "Step 2: Clinical interpretation using GPT-4 with medical knowledge"
echo "Step 3: Structured output generation with confidence scores"
```

## 3) Structured Data Extraction (JSON Schema Compliance)
```
Generate structured medical findings with validation.
```

### Bash (OpenAI with Schema Validation)
```bash
MEDICAL_SCHEMA=$(cat Prompting-Gold-Standard/JSON-Schemas/image-analysis.json)

EXTRACTION_SYSTEM='Extract medical findings as valid JSON matching the provided schema. Include anatomical locations, finding types, confidence scores, and clinical recommendations.'

EXTRACTION_USER=$(cat <<'USR'
Medical Image Analysis Context:
$(cat image_context.txt)

Diagnostic Requirements:
$(cat analysis_objective.txt)

Extract and structure:
- Anatomical regions examined
- Findings with precise locations
- Fracture classification and severity
- Measurement data and calculations
- Clinical recommendations
- Follow-up requirements
USR
)

# Schema-validated extraction ensures consistent, machine-readable output
echo "Structured extraction ensures interoperability with:"
echo "- Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems"
echo "- Clinical decision support systems"
echo "- Research databases and registries"
```

## 4) Clinical Insights & Recommendations
```
Generate clinical insights and treatment recommendations.
```

### Bash (OpenAI with Medical Knowledge)
```bash
INSIGHTS_SYSTEM='Provide clinical insights and recommendations based on imaging findings. Include treatment considerations, follow-up requirements, and risk assessments.'

INSIGHTS_USER=$(cat <<'USR'
Clinical Findings Context:
$(cat image_context.txt)

Diagnostic Analysis:
$(cat analysis_objective.txt)

Generate clinical insights covering:
1. Diagnosis confirmation and differential diagnosis
2. Treatment recommendations and urgency assessment
3. Follow-up imaging and clinical monitoring
4. Risk assessment and complications
5. Patient counseling and education points
6. Referral recommendations if needed
USR
)

# Clinical decision support with evidence-based recommendations
echo "Clinical insights integrate:"
echo "- Current medical literature and guidelines"

Combine visual analysis with textual clinical data.
```

### Bash (One-Block End-to-End)
```bash
set -euo pipefail
export OPENAI_MODEL=${OPENAI_MODEL:-gpt-4-vision-preview}
