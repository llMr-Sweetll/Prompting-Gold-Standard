```
You are a comprehensive pharmaceutical R&D expert. I need you to design a complete drug development program from discovery to regulatory approval.

DRUG DEVELOPMENT REQUEST:
Therapeutic Area: [DISEASE - e.g., "Breast Cancer (HER2-positive)"]
Target Molecule: [MOLECULE - e.g., "Small molecule kinase inhibitor"]
Development Stage: [STAGE - e.g., "Pre-clinical (Lead optimization)"]
Regulatory Path: [REGULATORY - e.g., "FDA Accelerated Approval + EMA Conditional MA"]
Budget: [BUDGET - e.g., "$150M over 7 years"]
Key Success Criteria: [CRITERIA - e.g., "Improved efficacy, reduced toxicity vs existing treatments"]

STEP-BY-STEP R&D PLANNING:

1. DRUG DISCOVERY PHASE:
   Conduct computational drug discovery:
   - Identify and validate molecular targets (proteins, pathways)
   - Perform virtual screening and molecular docking studies
   - Analyze structure-activity relationships (SAR)
   - Predict ADMET properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity)
   - Assess patent landscape and competitive positioning
   - Select lead compounds with optimal drug-like properties

2. PRE-CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PHASE:
   Design comprehensive pre-clinical studies:
   - Detailed ADMET profiling and optimization
   - Pharmacology studies (in vitro and in vivo efficacy)

   - Manufacturing process development and scale-up
   - IND-enabling studies and regulatory documentation

3. CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PHASE:
   Design phase-appropriate clinical trials:
   - Phase 1: Safety, PK/PD, dose escalation (20-100 subjects)
   - Phase 2: Proof-of-concept, optimal dose (100-300 subjects)
   - Phase 3: Registration, comparator vs placebo (300-3000 subjects)
   - Statistical analysis plans and power calculations
   - Patient recruitment strategies and inclusion/exclusion criteria

4. REGULATORY STRATEGY PHASE:
   Develop comprehensive regulatory approach:
   - FDA: Accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation
   - EMA: Conditional marketing authorization, PRIME scheme
   - Global regulatory harmonization and parallel development
   - Market access planning and health technology assessment
   - Post-approval pharmacovigilance and lifecycle management

5. PROJECT MANAGEMENT PHASE:
   Create detailed project plan:
   - Timeline with critical path and milestones
   - Budget allocation and resource requirements
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Go/no-go decision criteria at each phase
   - Success metrics and key performance indicators

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Start with target identification and drug discovery results
- Provide detailed pre-clinical development strategy
- Include clinical trial protocols and statistical analysis plans
- End with regulatory strategy and market access planning
- Add comprehensive project timeline and risk assessment

Focus on scientific rigor, regulatory compliance, and commercial viability throughout the development program.
