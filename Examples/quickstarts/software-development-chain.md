# Quickstart: Software Development Chain (Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Testing)

Complete software development lifecycle workflow from concept to production deployment. Produces:
- `requirements.json` (detailed functional and non-functional requirements)
- `architecture.md` (system architecture and design decisions)
- `implementation_plan.md` (development roadmap and coding standards)
- `testing_strategy.json` (comprehensive testing framework)
- `deployment_pipeline.md` (CI/CD and production deployment)

References: `Programming/Software-Engineering/requirements-engineering.md`, `Programming/Software-Engineering/architecture-design.md`, `Programming/Software-Engineering/testing-frameworks.md`.
