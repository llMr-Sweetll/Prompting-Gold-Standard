Ethical Issues: Patient consent, algorithmic bias, data privacy
Evidence: "The system showed 15% higher accuracy for male patients vs female patients, raising concerns about bias in training data"

Example 2:
Paper discusses: ML model for treatment recommendation
Ethical Issues: Transparency, accountability, informed consent
Evidence: "Black box nature of model makes it difficult for physicians to explain recommendations to patients"

- Which themes are most frequently discussed vs most critical?

Step 2: EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT
- What is the quality and quantity of evidence for each theme?
- Are there regional or institutional differences in ethical concerns?
- How have ethical considerations evolved over time?

Step 3: GAP ANALYSIS
- What ethical issues are under-researched?
- Which stakeholder perspectives are missing?
- What methodologies are lacking in the current literature?

Step 4: IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
- What are the practical implications for healthcare policy?
- What should be the priorities for future research?
- What immediate actions should healthcare institutions take?

Provide your synthesis with specific examples from the literature and clear reasoning for each conclusion.
